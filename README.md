This one is a generalized linear model based on a database posted on the OSF: https://osf.io/jy7d9/

The main objective of this model is to understand the level of predictability that the economic income has in other variables like health, wellness, etc. 
The model compares the fit model indexes before and after the displacement happened in different kinds of populations. 


The code is going to be ready in python and in R too. But, as we are working on int, it will take some time to be ready, for now its on progress.
